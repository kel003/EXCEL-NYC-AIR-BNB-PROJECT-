# EXCEL-NYC-AIR-BNB-PROJECT-
In this project I was given a data listing on excel and was asked to find the most attractive locations for Airbnb's in New York City. Finding the property revenue and ratings were key factors to discovering which Airbnb's were the top locations in our data.

Data cleaning was needed for the raw data listings. Removing all irrelevant data allows me to see what information is important and useful.

I want to tell a story with my data, so I created a pivot table to see which properties generated the highest revenue in New York.

Now that the profit statistics had been discovered, I created another table to see which rental sizes were the most reviewed on the Airbnb website.

My final step was conducting a data search of which neighborhood were the most attractive places to live. I once again used a pivot table and filtered it to show me the top 10 most reviewed neighborhoods in the city.
